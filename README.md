## Fashion-MNIST Image Classifier using Neural Networks

### Introduction
This assignment develop a neural network model using fashion-MNIST dataset.This dataset is used for image classification.This dataset is trained and evaluated using different optimization techniques and hyperparameter tuning.For this code, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Keras libraries are used for building the model and visualizing results. sklearn.model_selection is used for splitting the dataset into  two dataset training and testing.Various optimization algorithms and hyperparameter tuning methods are used to improve the model's performance.
